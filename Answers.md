1. What problem does the context API help solve?

Allow context to pass values between components without descriptive prop use. 

1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

Action are use to change state, state value is hold by the store, the reducers manage actions by taking in the state and creating a new one.

1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

Application state: is the app state at all times, component information can be transmitted easily. Component state: component state container able to transmit down props.

1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

redux-thunk: is a function able to return another function of asynchronous operation. action-creators: is a function that creates an action.

1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

Redux, allow for larger amount of data management easier.
